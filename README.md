# Virtual_Try_On
I executed this project under the guidance of Dr. Kaustuv Nag (assistant professor at IIIT Guwahati).
- Given a reference person image and a clothing image, the goal of the virtual try-on model is to
synthesize a new image of the same person wearing the target clothing such that the shape and
pose of the person, as well as the details of the clothing, are preserved.
- It helps consumers in making superior choices. Consumers get to explore the item at their possess
pace until they discover the proper choice.
- Virtual try-on represents a practical application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
- We were able to show that there is some identity loss among images generated by FIFA and ACGPN models.
